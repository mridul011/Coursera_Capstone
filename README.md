Q - A description of the problem and a discussion of the background. 

A - The problem is alot of severe accidents are happening on regular basis in multi region area and this needs to be taken care by the authorities. Accidents are happening either in the daylight or dark in street lights or sometimes the reason is unknown. Also there are various conditions by which these accidents are happening - roads condition plays an important role in determining how many accidents happens when such road condition was there. Moreover, weather condition plays an important role in such determination. If there is too much rain then its obvious that the road clarity would be compromised and more accidents are expected. Further more how the collion happens, where it happened?, how severe was the accident are the other determinants. So this is the business requirement and we can do anaylsis on these parameteric situation by using any classification model.

Q - A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem. 

A- The data has information about the person, place of accident happened and where, how, when, how they collided and other relevant information is avaialble. Moreover, we have categorical data available on a few columns. Data needs a proper clean up as a few columns need proper clean up and pre-processing of data. Later on we can select the classification model suitable for this data file. We can also visualize this data on world map, etc.
